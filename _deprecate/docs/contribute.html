        <h1>Contributing to the ontology</h1>
<p>There are two ways you can contribute to the ontology.</p>
<h3>Suggest minor changes on existing elements</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/emmo-repo/domain-electrochemistry/issues/new">Create a feature request</a> in a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue">Github Issue</a> to suggest edits to names, defintions, references on existing classes and properties.</p>
<h3>Propose additions/deletion of elements</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong>  We recommend contacting some of <a href="https://github.com/BIG-MAP/BattINFO">BattINFO</a> contributors in advance to discuss which additions deletions you wish to make.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>We recommend using the <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow">forking workflow</a> to contribute additions/deletions.
Fork this repository, clone the fork on your local PC, create your branch based on the existing <code>dev</code> branch (e.g. <code>dev_john_doe</code>) and work on the editions in you local copy.</p>
<p>You can edit ontologes in two main ways.
One is programmatically, using for instance <a href="https://github.com/emmo-repo/EMMOntoPy">EMMOntoPy</a>.
The second and more common is using the interface provided by the Protégé software.
In case of the latter, <a href="https://protege.stanford.edu/">install Protégé</a> and use it to open the ontology file you wish to edit.
Before adding elements, ensure Prot´égé is configured to create IRIs in the right format:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open Protégé</li>
<li>Go to File/Open and load the ontology file you wish to modify</li>
<li>Go to File/Preferences and there go to the New Entities Tab</li>
<li>Ensure you have configured the preferences as shown below:</li>
</ul>

  Here is the "Specified IRI" for you to copy: <code>https://emmo.info/electrochemistry#</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Once you have made your changes, commit them to your fork and <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request">create a pull request</a>.</li>
<li>We will merge the request after assessing it.</li>
</ul>
