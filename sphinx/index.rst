Electrochemistry Domain Ontology
================================

The Electrochemistry Domain Ontology is a specialized domain within the
Elementary Multiperspective Materials Ontology
`(EMMO) <https://github.com/emmo-repo/EMMO>`__, that encompasses
essential terms and relationships for electrochemical systems,
materials, methods, and data. Its primary objective is to enable the
creation of linked and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and
Reusable) data, thereby fostering advancements in research and
innovation within the realm of electrochemistry. This ontology serves as
a foundational resource for harmonizing electrochemical knowledge
representation, enhancing data interoperability, and accelerating
progress in electrochemical research and development.
