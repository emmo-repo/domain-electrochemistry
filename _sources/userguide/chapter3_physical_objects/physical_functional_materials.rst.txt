Functional Materials
====================

In the EMMO ontology, materials play a fundamental role in defining objects. Every physical entity is not only characterized by its **function** or **role** but also by the **material it is made of**. This dual classification allows us to describe things both as **materials** and as **products, tools, or components** within a given context.

For example, consider an **iron pan**. It is both **iron** (the material) and a **pan** (the functional object). Similarly, a **piece of aluminum foil** is both **aluminum** (the substance) and **foil** (the product form). In this way, materials and objects are inherently linkedâ€”what something **is made of** is just as important as what it **does**.

This material-centric approach ensures a consistent and structured way to describe physical things. It provides a framework where:
- Objects can be **classified based on their material composition**.
- The same material can take on **different roles in different contexts**.
- Knowledge about materials can be **integrated with product information**, making it easier to reason about their properties and applications.

By defining things in terms of their **material identity and functional role**, EMMO enables a clear and semantically rich way of representing the physical world.

Within the electrochemistry domain, several key classes of functional materials are commonly used. These include **Active Materials, Binders, Conductive Additives, Electrolytes, Separators,** and **Current Collectors**. 

The following subsections introduce each of these material classes, outlining their roles and providing practical guidelines for their use, along with real-world examples.
