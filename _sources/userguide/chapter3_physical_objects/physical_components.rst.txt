Components in Electrochemistry
==============================

In the EMMO ontology, electrochemical devices are described not only by their materials but also by their **structural components**. Each component in an electrochemical system serves a distinct function, contributing to the overall operation and performance of the device.

For example, an electrochemical device often consists of:
- **Current Collectors** that facilitate electron transport.
- **Electrodes** that store and release charge.
- **Separators** that prevent short circuits while allowing ion flow.
- **Cases** that encapsulate and protect the internal components.

This component-based approach ensures a structured and modular way to represent electrochemical systems, allowing:
- Classification of objects based on **function** rather than just material.
- Clear distinctions between **structural components** and **functional materials**.
- Integration of physical and chemical properties into a single semantic model.

The following subsections introduce key electrochemical components, outlining their roles and providing guidelines for their representation within the ontology.

By defining electrochemical components in terms of their **function, properties, and material composition**, the ontology enables a structured and interoperable framework for modeling electrochemical systems.
