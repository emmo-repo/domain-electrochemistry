Materials
=========

In EMMO, materials play a fundamental role in defining objects. An EMMO material is elucidated as, "the class of individuals standing for an amount of ordinary matter substance (or mixture of substances) in different states of matter or phases." An instance of a material (e.g. nitrogen) can represent any state of matter. The fact that the individual also belongs to other classes (e.g. Gas) would reveal the actual form in which the material is found. 

EMMO offers flexible terms to describe materials. The class ``Material`` is a generic description that is suitable for any kind of material. When more specificity is needed, sub-classes of materials can add nuance to the meaning, including ``ChemicalMaterial``, ``ManufacturedMaterial``, and ``NaturalMaterial``.

Let's explore some common materials used in electrochemistry! For convenience, the following sections are organized by phase (solids, liquids, and gases). But, as mentioned above, a material can be defined independent of its phase.
