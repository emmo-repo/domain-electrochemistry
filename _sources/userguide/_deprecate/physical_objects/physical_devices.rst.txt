Devices in Electrochemistry
===========================

In the EMMO ontology, **Electrochemical Devices** are systems that utilize electrochemical processes to store or convert energy. These devices are composed of various **electrochemical components**, including electrodes, electrolytes, separators, current collectors, and cases. Each device serves a particular function, such as energy storage, electrolysis, or sensing.

Common types of electrochemical devices include:
- **Batteries** – Energy storage systems that convert chemical energy into electrical energy.
- **Fuel Cells** – Devices that convert chemical energy from fuel directly into electricity through redox reactions.
- **Supercapacitors** – Electrochemical capacitors that store energy through charge separation rather than chemical reactions.
- **Electrolyzers** – Devices that use electrical energy to drive chemical reactions, such as water splitting.

This component-based approach ensures a structured way to represent electrochemical devices, enabling:
- **Classification based on function** rather than just material composition.
- **Clear distinctions between device types** while maintaining interoperability.
- **Integration of physical and chemical properties** into a single semantic framework.

The following section introduces the **ElectrochemicalDevice** class, outlining its role and providing guidelines for its representation within the ontology.
