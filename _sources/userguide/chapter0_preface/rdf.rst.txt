Resource Description Framework (RDF)
====================================

Conceptually, ontologies seem pretty great, right? But how are they implemented from a practical perspective? The **Resource Description Framework (RDF)** provides the answer. RDF is a fundamental standard for encoding, exchanging, and using graph data on the web. Developed and maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), it serves as the digital foundation for expressing ontologies in a machine-readable format.

Think of RDF as a universal language for describing *things* and their *relationships*. In RDF, everything we want to talk about is called a **resource** - this could be a physical object (like a steel sample), an abstract concept (like ductility), a dataset (like a csv file), or even a mathematical relationship (like Hooke's law). Just as human languages use subjects, verbs, and objects to express meaning, RDF uses a similar pattern to create statements that computers can process.

At its core, RDF expresses information as directed graphs, which are built from a few key concepts:

1. **Identifiers** serve as unique names for every entity or concept we want to talk about. In RDF, these typically take the form of URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers), ensuring that each thing we reference has a precise, unambiguous identity.  

2. **Classes** represent categories or types of things. For example, in EMMO, we might have classes for different types of materials, physical properties, or measurement units. Classes help us organize and group related concepts.  

3. **Properties** describe relationships between things or specify characteristics of entities. They allow us to express how different concepts are connected or what attributes they possess.  

4. **Triples** are the basic building blocks of RDF statements. Each triple consists of a subject, predicate, and object - similar to how we construct basic sentences in natural language. By combining triples, we can build complex networks of interconnected information.

As we explore these components in more detail, you'll see how they work together to create a robust framework for representing knowledge. The power of RDF lies not just in its ability to describe individual facts, but in how it enables us to connect and integrate information from different sources into a coherent whole.
