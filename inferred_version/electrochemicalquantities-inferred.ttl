An ampere-hour or amp-hour (symbol Ah, AHr,  A · h, A h) is a unit of electric charge, with sub-units milliampere-hour (mAh) and milliampere second (mAs). One ampere-hour is equal to 3600 coulombs (ampere-seconds), the electric charge transferred by a steady current of one ampere for one hour. The ampere-hour is frequently used in measurements of electrochemical systems such as electroplating and electrical batteries. The commonly seen milliampere-hour (mAh or mA · h) is one-thousandth of an ampere-hour (3.6  coulombs).

The symbol ua is recommended by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, and the international standard ISO 80000, while au is recommended by the International Astronomical Union, and is more common in Anglosphere countries. In general, the International System of Units only uses capital letters for the symbols of units which are named after individual scientists, while au or a.u. can also mean atomic unit or even arbitrary unit. However, the use of AU to refer to the astronomical unit is widespread. The astronomical constant whose value is one astronomical unit is referred to as unit distance and is given the symbol A.

One becquerel is the radiation caused by one disintegration per second; this is equivalent to about 27.0270 picocuries (pCi). The unit is named for a French physicist, Antoine-Henri Becquerel (1852-1908), the discoverer of radioactivity. Note: both the becquerel and the hertz are basically defined as one event per second, yet they measure different things. The hertz is used to measure the rates of events that happen periodically in a fixed and definite cycle. The becquerel is used to measure the rates of events that happen sporadically and unpredictably, not in a definite cycle.

The unit is based on the candela, the SI unit of luminous intensity, and the square metre, the SI unit of area. Nit (nt) is a deprecated non-SI name also used for this unit (1 nit = 1 cd/m²). As a measure of light emitted per unit area, this unit is frequently used to specify the brightness of a display device. Most consumer desktop liquid crystal displays have luminances of 200 to 300 cd/m²; the sRGB spec for monitors targets 80 cd/m2. HDTVs range from 450 to about 1000 cd/m2. Typically, calibrated monitors should have a brightness of 120 cd/m². Nit is believed to come from the Latin word nitere, to shine.

One coulomb is the amount of charge accumulated in one second by a current of one ampere. Electricity is actually a flow of charged particles, such as electrons, protons, or ions. The charge on one of these particles is a whole-number multiple of the charge e on a single electron, and one coulomb represents a charge of approximately 6.241 506 x 1018 e. The coulomb is named for a French physicist, Charles-Augustin de Coulomb (1736-1806), who was the first to measure accurately the forces exerted between electric charges.

Thus, it sets the magnitude of one degree Celsius and that of one kelvin as exactly the same. Additionally, it establishes the difference between the two scales' null points as being precisely 273.15 °C.

More than one numeral stands for the same number.
In the EMMO abstract entities do not exists, and numbers are simply defined by other numerals, so that a number is the class of all the numerals that are equivalent (e.g. 3 and 0011 are numerals that stands for the same number).
Or alternatively, an integer numeral may also stands for a set of a specific cardinality (e.g. 3 stands for a set of three apples). Rational and real numbers are simply a syntactic arrangment of integers (digits, in decimal system).
The fact that you can't give a name to a number without using a numeral or, in case of positive integers, without referring to a real world objects set with specific cardinality, suggests that the abstract concept of number is not a concept that can be practically used.
For these reasons, the EMMO will consider numerals and numbers as the same concept."""@en ;

A collection can be partitioned in maximally connected items called members. The members are self-connected entities and there is no direct causality relation between them.
The combination of collection and item concepts is the EMMO mereocausality alternative to set theory. However, two items can be members only if they are non direct causally connected, giving some constraints to a collection definition. For example, two entities which are directly connected cannot be two distinct members, while their interiors (i.e. the entities obtained by removing the layer of parts that provides the causal contact between them) can be."""@en ;

C60 fullerene is a molecule, since it has a finite periodicity and is made of a well defined number of atoms (essential). A C nanotube is not a molecule, since it has an infinite periodicity (redundant)."""@en ;

The quantum concept recalls the fact that there is lower epistemological limit to our knowledge of the universe, related to the uncertainity principle.
Space and time emerge following the network of causal connections between quantum objects. So quantum objects are adimensional objects, that precede space and time dimensions: they are simple beings (in greek οντα).
Using physics concepts, we can think the quantum as an elementary particle (e.g. an electron) in a specific state between two causal interactions."""@en ;

This distinction is not well assessed in actual chemical nomenclature, in which an element name refers to both the pure elemental substance or the atom.

In the EMMO we force the adoption of a more strict categorization based on mereotopology.

The class Material hosts the subclasses for which a substance can be identified without necessarily considering its nature of molecule/atom or substance (e.g. hydrocarbon is the class of both hydrocarbon molecules or gases).""" ;

If the waveform is travelling through a cable as electronic signal (analog or digital) it is no more a sound, since it cannot be perceived by an observer as an acoustical object.

Several concepts are labelled with this term, depending on the field of science. The concept mass is sometimes related to the term \"matter\", even if the former refers to a physical quantity (precisely defined by modern physics) while the latter is a type that qualifies a physical entity.
It is possible to identify more than one concept that can be reasonably labelled with the term \"matter\". For example, it is possible to label as matter only the entities that are made up of atoms. Or more generally, we can be more fine-grained and call \"matter\" the entities that are made up of protons, neutrons or electrons, so that we can call matter also a neutron radiation or a cathode ray.
A more fundamental approach, that we embrace for the EMMO, considers matter as entities that are made of fermions (i.e. quarks and leptons). This would exclude particles like the W and Z bosons that possess some mass, but are not fermions.
Antimatter is a subclass of matter."""@en ;

This semiotic process occurs at meta-level: it's how I use the EMMO as tool for a direct representation of the world, understandable by others ontologists.

The semiotic process within EMMO:
My friend looks at the same cloud and says: \"It is an elephant\".
I use the EMMO to record this experience by declaring:
    - my friend as MyFriend individual, belonging to 'Interpreter' classes
    - the sound of the word \"elephant\" as an acoustical perception individual named ElephantWord, belonging to 'Perceptual'
    - a relation hasSign between Cloud and ElephantWord, that makes ElephantWord also belonging to 'Sign' class and Cloud belonging also to 'Object' class
    - a 'Semiosis' individual called MyFriendElephantCloud that hasParticipant: Cloud, ElephantWord and MyFriend, respectively as object, sign and interpreter.

This perspective is based on human characterization of perceptions.

In other words, a 'Perceptual' is a meta-object, meaning that is addressed by the ontologist (the meta-interpreter) in a semiotic process occurring outside the EMMO. The 'Perceptual' branch is here to facilitate the connection between an individual and the real-world object for which it stands for.

A 'Perceptual' can stand for another object in an EMMO described semiotic process (acting as sign or as object), just like a word on a paper (the perceptual object) may refer semiotically to another object. However, a perceptual is not necessarily a 'Sign' (e.g. a line sketched on a blackboard is a recognizable 'Perceptual' but it may stand for nothing).

A 'Perceptual' becomes an 'Object', when it is part of a 'Semiotic' process described by the ontologist within the EMMO, and it's done always specifying for which interpreter this relation occurs."""@en ;

Examples of physical properties include density, index of refraction, magnetization and chemical composition. A simple description is that a phase is a region of material that is chemically uniform, physically distinct, and (often) mechanically separable. In a system consisting of ice and water in a glass jar, the ice cubes are one phase, the water is a second phase, and the humid air is a third phase over the ice and water. The glass of the jar is another separate phase.

The term phase is sometimes used as a synonym for state of matter, but there can be several immiscible phases of the same state of matter. Also, the term phase is sometimes used to refer to a set of equilibrium states demarcated in terms of state variables such as pressure and temperature by a phase boundary on a phase diagram. Because phase boundaries relate to changes in the organization of matter, such as a change from liquid to solid or a more subtle change from one crystal structure to another, this latter usage is similar to the use of \"phase\" as a synonym for state of matter. However, the state of matter and phase diagram usages are not commensurate with the formal definition given above and the intended meaning must be determined in part from the context in which the term is used."""@en ;

The EMMO relies on strong reductionism, i.e. everything real is a formless collection of elementary particles: we give a meaning to real world entities only by giving them boundaries and defining them using 'sign'-s.

In this way the 'sign'-ed entity becomes an 'object', and the 'object' is the basic entity needed in order to apply a logical formalism to the real world entities (i.e. we can speak of it through its sign, and use logics on it through its sign)."""@en ;

A coded is always a partial representation of an object since it reflects the object capability to be part of a specific determination.
A coded is a sort of name or label that we put upon objects that interact with an determiner in the same specific way.

For example, \"hot\" objects are objects that interact with an observer through a perception mechanism aimed to perceive an heat source. The code is made of terms such as \"hot\", \"warm\", \"cold\", that commonly refer to the perception of heat."""@en ,

An individual C of this class Colour can be defined be declaring the process individual (e.g. daylight illumination) and the observer (e.g. my eyes)
Stating that an entity E hasCoded C, we mean that it can be observed by such setup of process + observer (i.e. observed by my eyes under daylight).
This definition can be specialised for human eye perception, so that the observer can be a generic human, or to camera perception so that the observer can be a device.

However that's not possible in general, since we will finally end to temporal parts whose temporal extension is so small that the connectivity relations that define the object will no longer hold. That's the case when the temporal interval is lower than the interval that characterize the causality interactions between the object parts.
In other terms, if the time span of a temporal part is lower than the inverse of the frequency of interactions between the constituents, then the constituents in such temporal part are not connected. The object is no more an object, neither an item, but simply a collection of fundamental parts.
To overcome this issue, we can identify an minimum holistic temporal part (a lower time interval value), below which a specific definition for an object type does not hold anymore, that is called a fundamental."""@en ;

In general the dimension of any quantity Q is written in the form of a dimensional product,

    dim Q = T^α L^β M^γ I^δ Θ^ε N^ζ J^η

where the exponents α, β, γ, δ, ε, ζ and η, which are generally small integers, which can be positive, negative, or zero, are called the dimensional exponents.
-- SI brouchure

The SI dimensional units are equivalent to dimensional strings that uniquely defines their dimensionality by specifying the values of the coefficients α, β, γ, δ, ε, ζ and η. A dimensional string is a space-separated string of the physical dimension symbols followed by the value of the exponent (including it sign). They should always match the following regular expression:

^T([+-][1-9]|0) L([+-][1-9]|0) M([+-][1-9]|0) I([+-][1-9]|0) Θ([+-][1-9]|0) N([+-][1-9]|0) J([+-][1-9]|0)$

Examples of correspondance between dimensional units and their dimensional units are:

- AmountOfSubstanceUnit <=> \"T0 L0 M0 I0 Θ0 N+1 J0\"
- TimeUnit <=> \"T+1 L0 M0 I0 Θ0 N0 J0\"
- ElectricCurrentDensityUnit <=> \"T0 L-2 M0 I+1 Θ0 N0 J0\""""@en ;

One of the most general one applicable to causal systems is to ask that all the quantum parts of the system are bonded to the rest.
In other words, causal convexity excludes all quantums that leave the system (no more interacting), or that are not yet part of it (not yet interacting).
So, a photon leaving a body is not part of the body as convex system, while a photon the is carrier of electromagnetic interaction between two molecular parts of the body, is part of the convex body."""@en ;

The triadic elements:
- 'sign': the sign A (e.g. a name)
- 'interpretant': the sign B as the effects of the sign A on the interpreter (e.g. the mental concept of what a name means)
- 'object': the object C (e.g. the entity to which the sign A and B refer to)

This class includes also the 'interpeter' i.e. the entity that connects the 'sign' to the 'object'"""@en ;

Rather it embraces the fact that the physical dimensionality of a physical quantity is carried by its measurement unit. 

The role of dimensional unit and its subclasses is to express the physical dimensionality that is carried by the unit.

Since the dimensionality of a physical quantity can be written as the product of powers of the physical dimensions of the base quantities in the selected system of quantities, the physical dimensionality of a measurement unit is uniquely determined by the exponents. For a dimensional unit, at least one of these exponents must be non-zero (making it disjoint from dimensionless units)."""@en ;

- object (focus on spatial configuration)
- process (focus on temporal evolution)

The concepts of endurant and perdurant implicitly rely on the concept of instantaneous 3D snapshot of the world object, that in the EMMO is not allowed since everything extends in 4D and there are no abstract objects. Moreover, time is a measured property in the EMMO and not an objective characteristic of an object, and cannot be used as temporal index to identify endurant position in time. 

For this reason an individual in the EMMO can always be classified both endurant and perdurant, due to its nature of 4D entity (e.g. an individual may belong both to the class of runners and the class of running process), and the distinction is purely semantic.  In fact, the object/process distinction is simply a matter of convenience in a 4D approach since a temporal extension is always the case, and stationarity depends upon observer time scale. For this reason, the same individual (4D object) may play the role of a process or of an object class depending on the object to which it relates.

Nevertheless, it is useful to introduce categorizations that characterize persistency through continuant and occurrent concepts, even if not ontologically but only cognitively defined. This is also due to the fact that our language distinguish between nouns and verbs to address things, forcing the separation between things that happens and things that persist.

This perspective provides classes conceptually similar to the concepts of endurant and perdurant (a.k.a. continuant and occurrent). We claim that this distinction is motivated by our cognitive bias, and we do not commit to the fact that both these kinds of entity “do really exist”. For this reason, a whole instance can be both process and object, according to different cognitive approaches (see Wonderweb D17).

The distinction between endurant and perdurant as usually introduced in literature (see BFO SPAN/SNAP approach) is then no more ontological, but can still be expressed through the introduction of ad hoc primitive definitions that follow the interpreter endurantist or perdurantist attitude."""@en ;

Members of a collection lack such direct causality connection, i.e. they do not constitute a physical object.

You can imagine that the electron starts at the negative plate of a parallel plate capacitor and accelerates to the positive plate, which is at one volt higher potential. Numerically 1 eV approximates 1.6x10⁻¹⁹ joules, where 1 joule is 6.2x10¹⁸ eV. For example, it would take 6.2x10²⁰ eV/sec to light a 100 watt light bulb.

Very early in the study of electricity scientists discovered that a pair of conductors separated by an insulator can store a much larger charge than an isolated conductor can store. The better the insulator, the larger the charge that the conductors can hold. This property of a circuit is called capacitance, and it is measured in farads. One farad is defined as the ability to store one coulomb of charge per volt of potential difference between the two conductors. This is a natural definition, but the unit it defines is very large. In practical circuits, capacitance is often measured in microfarads, nanofarads, or sometimes even in picofarads (10⁻¹² farad, or trillionths of a farad). The unit is named for the British physicist Michael Faraday (1791-1867), who was known for his work in electricity and electrochemistry.

A changing magnetic field induces an electric current in a loop of wire (or in a coil of many loops) located in the field. Although the induced voltage depends only on the rate at which the magnetic flux changes, measured in webers per second, the amount of the current depends also on the physical properties of the coil. A coil with an inductance of one henry requires a flux of one weber for each ampere of induced current. If, on the other hand, it is the current which changes, then the induced field will generate a potential difference within the coil: if the inductance is one henry a current change of one ampere per second generates a potential difference of one volt. The henry is a large unit; inductances in practical circuits are measured in millihenrys (mH) or microhenrys (μH). The unit is named for the American physicist Joseph Henry (1797-1878), one of several scientists who discovered independently how magnetic fields can be used to generate alternating currents.

A pitch of a note goes up one octave when its frequency doubles, meaning that the voltage will have to double for every octave rise. Depending on the footage (octave) selected, nominally one volt gives 1000Hz, two volts 2000Hz and so on. In terms of notes, bottom C would be 0.25 volts, the next C up would be 0.5 volts, then 1V, 2V, 4V, 8V for the following octaves. This system was used mainly by Yamaha and Korg.

Energy is measured in joules, and the amount of material is measured in moles. Physical quantities measured in J· mol⁻¹) usually describe quantities of energy transferred during phase transformations or chemical reactions. Division by the number of moles facilitates comparison between processes involving different quantities of material and between similar processes involving different types of materials. The meaning of such a quantity is always context-dependent and, particularly for chemical reactions, is dependent on the (possibly arbitrary) definition of a 'mole' for a particular process.

A loop of electric current, a bar magnet, an electron, a molecule, and a planet all have magnetic moments. The unit for magnetic moment is not a base unit in the International System of Units (SI) and it can be represented in more than one way. For example, in the current loop definition, the area is measured in square meters and I is measured in amperes, so the magnetic moment is measured in ampere-square meters (A m2). In the equation for torque on a moment, the torque is measured in joules and the magnetic field in tesla, so the moment is measured in Joules per Tesla (J u00b7T-1). These two representations are equivalent: 1 A u00b7m2 = 1 J u00b7T-1.

Thermal resistance is the reciprocal thermal conductance. Absolute thermal resistance is the temperature difference across a structure when a unit of heat energy flows through it in unit time. It is the reciprocal of thermal conductance. The SI units of thermal resistance are kelvins per watt or the equivalent degrees Celsius per watt (the two are the same since as intervals).

As a derived unit it is composed from the SI base units of length, the metre, and the standard unit of time, the second. Its symbol is written in several forms as m/s², or m s⁻². As acceleration, the unit is interpreted physically as change in velocity or speed per time interval, that is, `metre per second per second`.

The value of a ratio in nepers is given by `ln(x1/x2)` where `x1` and `x2` are the values of interest (amplitudes), and ln is the natural logarithm. When the values are quadratic in the amplitude (e.g. power), they are first linearised by taking the square root before the logarithm is taken, or equivalently the result is halved.

It has the unit symbol Np. The unit's name is derived from the name of John Napier, the inventor of logarithms. As is the case for the decibel and bel, the neper is not a unit in the International System of Units (SI), but it is accepted for use alongside the SI. Like the decibel, the neper is a unit in a logarithmic scale. While the bel uses the decadic (base-10) logarithm to compute ratios, the neper uses the natural logarithm, based on Euler's number

The most important property of a conductor is the amount of current it will carry when a voltage is applied. Current flow is opposed by resistance in all circuits, and by also by reactance and impedance in alternating current circuits. Conductance, susceptance, and admittance are the inverses of resistance, reactance, and impedance, respectively. To measure these properties, the siemens is the reciprocal of the ohm. In other words, the conductance, susceptance, or admittance, in siemens, is simply 1 divided by the resistance, reactance or impedance, respectively, in ohms. The unit is named for the German electrical engineer Werner von Siemens (1816-1892).

It is denoted in various ways, including deg, sq. deg. and °². Just as degrees are used to measure parts of a circle, square degrees are used to measure parts of a sphere. Analogous to one degree being equal to π /180 radians, a square degree is equal to (π /180) or about 1/3283 steradian. The number of square degrees in a whole sphere is or approximately 41 253 deg. This is the total area of the 88 constellations in the list of constellations by area. For example, observed from the surface of the Earth, the Moon has a diameter of approximately 0.5°, so it covers a solid angle of approximately 0.196 deg, which is 4.8 × 10 of the total sky sphere.

The intensity of a magnetic field can be measured by placing a current-carrying conductor in the field. The magnetic field exerts a force on the conductor, a force which depends on the amount of the current and on the length of the conductor. One tesla is defined as the field intensity generating one newton of force per ampere of current per meter of conductor. Equivalently, one tesla represents a magnetic flux density of one weber per square meter of area. A field of one tesla is quite strong: the strongest fields available in laboratories are about 20 teslas, and the Earth's magnetic flux density, at its surface, is about 50 microteslas. The tesla, defined in 1958, honors the Serbian-American electrical engineer Nikola Tesla (1856-1943), whose work in electromagnetic induction led to the first practical generators and motors using alternating current.

This unit is used both in mechanics and in electricity, so it links the mechanical and electrical units to one another. In mechanical terms, one watt equals about 0.001 341 02 horsepower (hp) or 0.737 562 foot-pound per second (lbf/s). In electrical terms, one watt is the power produced by a current of one ampere flowing through an electric potential of one volt. The name of the unit honors James Watt (1736-1819), the British engineer whose improvements to the steam engine are often credited with igniting the Industrial Revolution.

The weber is a large unit, equal to 10⁸ maxwells, and practical fluxes are usually fractions of one weber. The weber is the magnetic flux which, linking a circuit of one turn, would produce in it an electromotive force of 1 volt if it were reduced to zero at a uniform rate in 1 second. In SI base units, the dimensions of the weber are (kg·m²)/(s²·A). The weber is commonly expressed in terms of other derived units as the Tesla-square meter (T·m²), volt-seconds (V·s), or joules per ampere (J/A)."@en ;
