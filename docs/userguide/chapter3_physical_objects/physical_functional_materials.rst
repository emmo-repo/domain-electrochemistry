Functional Materials
====================

In EMMO, materials play a fundamental role in defining objects. Every physical entity is not only characterized by its **function** or **role** but also by the **material it is made of**. This dual classification allows us to describe things both as **materials** and as **products, tools, or components** within a given context.

For example, consider an **iron pan**. It is both **iron** (the material) and a **pan** (the functional object). Similarly, **aluminum foil** is both **aluminum** (the substance) and **foil** (the product form). In this way, materials and objects are inherently linkedâ€”what something **is made of** is just as important as what it **does**.

Let's explore some common functional materials used in electrochemistry!
