Resource Description Framework (RDF)
====================================

Ontologies are built on a few simple foundational components that can be combined to express knowledge. These include:  
- Identifiers  
- Classes   
- Properties  
- Triples  

These components each build upon eachother to create an ontological framework, and we will introduce them one-by-one.
