Properties and Quantities
-------------------------

A **property** is a characteristic or feature of something that can be described, measured, or categorized. Think of it as a way to answer specific questions about an object or system, like:

- What color is it? (e.g., black, red)
- How heavy is it? (e.g., 1.4 kg)
- What is its hardness? (e.g., "Vickers hardness" measures how hard a material is using a standard test)

In the EMMO framework, a property is very precise, focusing on one clear aspect of an object or system. For example, "red" could be a property of a list of colors, or "1.4 kg" could describe the weight of an object.

Properties are like labels or codes that help us describe the world in an organized way, using agreed-upon standards to ensure everyone interprets the information the same way.

Types of Properties in EMMO
---------------------------

**1. Objective Properties**
An objective property is a property determined through a well-defined procedure, ensuring systematic and repeatable results. There are three key types of objective properties:

- **Conventional Property**:
  A property whose value is determined by convention or agreement. For example, a copper sample's thermal conductivity provided in a vendor specification sheet.

- **Measured Property**:
  A property explicitly measured through direct observation or instrumentation. For instance, measuring the mass of an object using a scale.

- **Modelled Property**:
  A property calculated using a well-defined model. For example, a diffusion coefficient derived from experimental data using a mathematical model.

**2. Subjective Properties**
These are properties whose values cannot be objectively measured and depend on the perception or opinion of an agent (e.g., a person or community). For instance, "beauty on a scale of 1 to 10."

**3. Physical Quantities**
A physical quantity refers to measurable aspects of physical systems, such as mass, length, or temperature. These are often represented by numerical values and units, following SI conventions.

**4. Ordinal Quantities**
An ordinal quantity is a property that allows comparison or ordering but does not permit algebraic operations. For example, Rockwell C hardness values can rank material hardness but are not mathematically additive.

Quantities in EMMO
------------------
Quantities follow the SI convention, where they are expressed as a combination of a numerical value and a unit. This ensures consistency and standardization across all linked data.

- Examples of Quantities:
  - Length: "2 meters"
  - Mass: "1.4 kilograms"
  - Electric Resistance: "50 ohms"

Units
-----

Units are essential for expressing quantities. EMMO supports both SI and non-SI units.

- **SI Units**: These are the standard units defined by the International System of Units (e.g., meter, kilogram, second).
- **Non-SI Units**: These include units accepted for use alongside SI units (e.g., liter, minute) or domain-specific units like electronvolt (eV) in physics.
