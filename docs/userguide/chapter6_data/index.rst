Data is `defined <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data>`_ as any collection of symbols and values that can be formally interpreted to convey information. This is a very broad definition: code, documents, spreadsheets, databases, annotations in a copybook, are all data. Creating semantic descriptions for each type of data is daunting, but we can narrow our scope by identifying the most common types of data used in electrochemistry.  

Most electrochemical datasets are collections of variables or properties, along with their associated values, which are observed from electrochemical measurements or simulations. Datasets are usually stored in a single file, each with a defined protocol to arrange and encode observations. In the following sections we will describe more closely the ways of arranging and encoding data, which form the basis of how to describe data semantically.
