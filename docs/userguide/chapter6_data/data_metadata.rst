Metadata
========

What we will describe with semantic annotation is *metadata*, i.e. data about the data. It is the list of properties describing a subject, which in our case will be a data file. Metadata is instrumental to help humans and computers understand files, i.e. to explicitly describe its source, contents, creator, purpose, maintainance, etc. There is a large list of metadata properties to describe files, many ways to `categorize <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata#Types>`_ such properties, and several `standards <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata_standard#Available_metadata_standards>`_  and `guidelines <https://data.research.cornell.edu/data-management/storing-and-managing/metadata/>`_ with rules to describe data.

To the best of our knowledge, there is no metadata standard tailored to electrochemical data. Instead, our guideline draws inspiration from several standards and guidelines we consider authoritative, widely used, rigorously managed and applicable to us:  

* `Dublin Core (DC) <https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/>`_. Specification for metadata terms for digital resources, including datasets. It is widely used and regularly maintained by an independent organization, the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative.
* `Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT) <https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/>`_. A vocabulary of metadata terms to describe datasets and data catalogs (i.e. repositories) in the web. It is developed and maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
* `Schema.org <https://schema.org/>`_. Set of schemas to describe web pages with a common set of structured properties. It is designed to improve the discoverability of web pages by search engines, and it is maintained by a community of developers and organizations, including Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and Yandex.
* `FAIR Data principles <https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/>`_. A set of guiding principles to make data machine-actionable, i.e. findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable by computational systems. The principles are promoted by the GO FAIR Initiative.

In the following sections we will describe metadata properties common to all file types, and then metadata properties particular to each file type.
