Introduction
============

In the ontology, **electrochemical processes** describe the dynamic interactions that involve electrochemical systems. These processes include charging-discharging cycles, electrochemical characterization methods, electrochemical reactions, and more. The ontology provides a structured way to represent and analyze these processes to ensure semantic clarity and interoperability.

Overview of Electrochemical Processes
-------------------------------------
Electrochemical processes involve a sequence of controlled steps where electrical energy is either stored, released, or used to drive chemical reactions. Common electrochemical procedures include:

- **Cycling Procedures** (e.g., constant current cycling, constant voltage charging)
- **Electrochemical Characterization** (e.g., cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy)
- **Material Performance Tests** (e.g., rated capacity tests, retention and recovery studies)

These processes are essential for evaluating battery performance, material stability, and device efficiency.

Defining Electrochemical Processes in EMMO
------------------------------------------
To represent an **Electrochemical Process** in EMMO, follow these structured steps:

### Step 1: Define the Process
Start by identifying the type of process being represented.

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "@context": "https://w3id.org/emmo/domain/electrochemistry/context",
     "@type": "Process"
   }

### Step 2: Define the Properties of the Process
Each process has specific properties such as applied current, voltage range, scan rate, or cycle count.

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "@context": "https://w3id.org/emmo/domain/electrochemistry/context",
     "@type": "ChargeProcess",
     "hasCurrent": {
       "@type": "Current",
       "hasNumericalPart": {
         "@type": "RealData",
         "hasNumericalValue": 1.0
       },
       "hasMeasurementUnit": "emmo:Ampere"
     }
   }

### Step 3: Define Inputs and Outputs
Processes involve materials as inputs and generate outputs such as measurements or transformed materials.

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "@context": "https://w3id.org/emmo/domain/electrochemistry/context",
     "@type": "CyclicVoltammetry",
     "hasInput": {
       "@type": "ElectrodeSample"
     },
     "hasOutput": {
       "@type": "Voltammogram"
     }
   }

### Step 4: Define Links to Other Processes
Processes often consist of multiple tasks or subprocesses. These can be defined using `hasSubProcess` or `hasTask` properties.

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "@context": "https://w3id.org/emmo/domain/electrochemistry/context",
     "@type": "ElectrochemicalWorkflow",
     "hasTask": [
       {
         "@type": "ChargeCycle"
       },
       {
         "@type": "DischargeCycle"
       }
     ]
   }

Types of Electrochemical Workflows
----------------------------------

### Serial Workflow
A **Serial Workflow** consists of processes that must be completed in sequence.

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "@context": "https://w3id.org/emmo/domain/electrochemistry/context",
     "@type": "SerialWorkflow",
     "hasTask": [
       { "@type": "ChargeCycle" },
       { "@type": "DischargeCycle" }
     ]
   }

### Parallel Workflow
A **Parallel Workflow** contains multiple tasks that run concurrently, such as simultaneous material characterization and electrochemical cycling.

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "@context": "https://w3id.org/emmo/domain/electrochemistry/context",
     "@type": "ParallelWorkflow",
     "hasTask": [
       { "@type": "ElectrochemicalImpedanceSpectroscopy" },
       { "@type": "CyclicVoltammetry" }
     ]
   }

### Iterative Workflow
An **Iterative Workflow** repeats the same process multiple times, useful for degradation studies and long-term cycling tests.

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "@context": "https://w3id.org/emmo/domain/electrochemistry/context",
     "@type": "IterativeWorkflow",
     "hasTask": {
       "@type": "ChargeDischargeCycle",
       "hasCycleCount": {
         "@type": "IntegerData",
         "hasNumericalValue": 100
       }
     }
   }

Object Properties for Electrochemical Processes
----------------------------------------------
Electrochemical processes use specific relationships to define their structure:

- **hasCurrent**: Defines the applied current in an electrochemical experiment.
- **hasVoltage**: Specifies the voltage range or limits.
- **hasScanRate**: Describes the scan rate for voltammetry.
- **hasCapacity**: Indicates the storage capacity of a battery.
- **hasInput**: Defines the input material or sample.
- **hasOutput**: Defines the resulting data or material.
- **hasSubProcess**: Links a process to a subprocess occurring within it.
- **hasTask**: Links a workflow to its specific tasks.

By structuring electrochemical processes with EMMO, researchers and engineers can ensure **interoperability**, **repeatability**, and **semantic clarity** in data representation.
