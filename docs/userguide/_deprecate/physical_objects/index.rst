Physical Objects in Electrochemistry
====================================

Understanding how physical objects are represented in the electrochemistry domain is essential for describing experimental setups and materials. When we perform experiments, we work with tangible objects like electrodes, cells, and instruments. The ontology helps us describe these objects, their properties, and how they relate to each other in a standardized way.

Consider a typical three-electrode cell setup. It contains:

* A working electrode where our reaction of interest occurs
* A counter electrode that completes the circuit
* A reference electrode that provides a stable potential
* An electrolyte solution
* Various connectors and containers

Each of these physical objects plays a specific role, has particular properties, and interacts with other objects in defined ways. In the ontology, we capture not just the objects themselves, but also:

* Their composition and structure
* Their functional roles
* Their spatial relationships
* Their measurement capabilities
* Their operating conditions

The following sections will explore how we represent these different aspects of physical objects in the ontology, starting with basic laboratory equipment and moving on to more specialized apparatus. We'll see how these representations help maintain consistent descriptions across different experiments and laboratories.
