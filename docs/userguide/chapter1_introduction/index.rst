The Electrochemistry Domain Ontology
====================================

The Electrochemistry Domain Ontology is a resource managing knowledge about electrochemistry. It provides a standardized way to describe electrochemical concepts, experiments, and data. Whether you're working with batteries, fuel cells, corrosion studies, or electroanalytical methods, this ontology helps you structure your data in a way that makes it findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR).

Why Use the Electrochemistry Ontology?
--------------------------------------

Imagine you're recording data from cyclic voltammetry experiments. You have voltage sweeps, current responses, scan rates, and electrode materials. How do you store this information so that:

* Other researchers can easily understand your setup  
* Data analysis software can automatically process your results  
* Your findings can be compared with similar experiments  
* The relationships between different parameters are clear  

This is where the Electrochemistry ontology comes in. It provides a structured vocabulary and set of relationships that help you describe your electrochemical work in a standardized way.

What Can You Describe?
----------------------
The ontology covers key aspects of electrochemistry including:

* Experimental setups (electrodes, cells, electrolytes)
* Measurement techniques (voltammetry, impedance spectroscopy, chronoamperometry)
* Physical quantities (potential, current, charge)
* Materials and substances
* Analysis methods and data processing
* Common relationships in electrochemical systems

Getting Started
----------------------
In the following sections, we'll explore how to:

* Use basic electrochemical concepts and relationships
* Describe your experimental setups
* Link your measurement data
* Connect with other EMMO domains
* Query and analyze electrochemical data

Whether you're new to ontologies or just want to make your electrochemical data more accessible, this guide will help you get started with structured data representation in electrochemistry.
