# Ontology Basics

## What is an Ontology?
An ontology is a formal representation of knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain, along with their relationships.

## Key Elements
- **Class**: A category of entities (e.g., `ElectrochemicalCell`).
- **Property**: Describes relationships or attributes (e.g., `hasElectrolyte`).
- **Individual**: A specific instance of a class (e.g., `BatteryCell123`).

## How to Use the Ontology
- Identify the relevant class or property for your task.
- Use SPARQL to query the ontology for data.
- Reference `@context` for JSON-LD integration.
